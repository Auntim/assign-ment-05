                The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the
                structure of a webpage so that programming languages (like JavaScript) can interact with and manipulate
                the document's content, structure, and style.

                Why use DOM in JS?
            </summary>
            <div class="p-4 text-gray-600">
                Using the DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript is essential for creating dynamic, interactive web
                pages. The DOM allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a
                web page in real-time. Hereâ€™s why the DOM is so crucial in JavaScript:
                <br>
                <hr>
                1. Dynamic Content Manipulation
                With the DOM, you can change the content of an HTML page without requiring a page reload. This allows
                for dynamic updates, such as changing text, images, or other elements based on user interaction.
                <br>
                <hr>
                2. Handling User Interactions
                The DOM provides event-handling mechanisms (e.g., clicks, keyboard input, form submissions) so
                JavaScript can respond to user interactions.
                <br>
                <hr>
                3. Style and Attribute Manipulation
                JavaScript can modify the CSS styles or HTML attributes of elements via the DOM, allowing for dynamic
                styling based on user actions or conditions.

                How it works in Website?
            </summary>
            <div class="p-4 text-gray-600">
                The DOM (Document Object Model) works in a website by acting as an interface between the webpage's
                structure (HTML) and JavaScript, allowing dynamic changes to the page content, structure, and style.
                Here's an overview of how the DOM operates in a website and how it interacts with HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript:
                <br>

                1. Page Load and DOM Creation:
                When a web browser loads a webpage, it first fetches the HTML document from the server.
                The browser then parses the HTML document and constructs the DOM. The DOM is essentially a tree-like
                structure where each HTML element (like <div>, <p>, etc.) becomes a "node" in this tree.
                        As the browser parses the HTML, it creates the DOM in memory, so JavaScript can interact with it
                        later.
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        2. DOM Representation
                        The DOM represents the entire structure of the webpage in a hierarchical tree form. Every HTML
                        element, attribute, and text becomes a part of this tree.
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        3. DOM and CSS
                        Once the DOM is created, the browser then parses the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that are
                        linked or embedded in the HTML.
                        The browser applies styles to the DOM elements based on CSS rules. The visual representation of
                        the page is determined by applying these styles to the DOM nodes.

                How do you select an element from the DOM?
            </summary>
            <div class="p-4 text-gray-600">
                To select an element from the DOM, JavaScript provides multiple methods, each useful for different
                scenarios. The DOM (Document Object Model) represents the structure of a webpage, and these methods
                allow you to access or modify the elements within it. Here's a brief explanation of the most commonly
                used DOM selection methods:
                <br>
                <hr>

                1. getElementById()
                What it does: Selects an element by its unique id attribute.
                When to use: Use this when you know the id of an element and need to select it. IDs should be unique
                across the entire document.
                Example: If an element has id="header", this method will return that specific element.
                <br>
                <hr>
                2. getElementsByClassName()
                What it does: Selects all elements that have a particular class name.
                When to use: Use this when you want to select all elements with a certain class. This method returns an
                array-like structure called an HTMLCollection.
                Example: If multiple elements share the class button, this method will return all of them.
                <br>
                <hr>
                3. getElementsByTagName()
                What it does: Selects all elements with a specific tag name (like div, p, or button).
                When to use: Use this when you need to retrieve all elements of a certain type, such as all div elements
                on the page.
                Example: If you want all p (paragraph) elements, this method will give you access to each one.

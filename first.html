                The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the
                structure of a webpage so that programming languages (like JavaScript) can interact with and manipulate
                the document's content, structure, and style.

                Why use DOM in JS?
            </summary>
            <div class="p-4 text-gray-600">
                Using the DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript is essential for creating dynamic, interactive web
                pages. The DOM allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the content, structure, and style of a
                web page in real-time. Hereâ€™s why the DOM is so crucial in JavaScript:
                <br>
                <hr>
                1. Dynamic Content Manipulation
                With the DOM, you can change the content of an HTML page without requiring a page reload. This allows
                for dynamic updates, such as changing text, images, or other elements based on user interaction.
                <br>
                <hr>
                2. Handling User Interactions
                The DOM provides event-handling mechanisms (e.g., clicks, keyboard input, form submissions) so
                JavaScript can respond to user interactions.
                <br>
                <hr>
                3. Style and Attribute Manipulation
                JavaScript can modify the CSS styles or HTML attributes of elements via the DOM, allowing for dynamic
                styling based on user actions or conditions.

                How it works in Websie?
            </summary>
            <div class="p-4 text-gray-600">
                The DOM (Document Object Model) works in a website by acting as an interface between the webpage's
                structure (HTML) and JavaScript, allowing dynamic changes to the page content, structure, and style.
                Here's an overview of how the DOM operates in a website and how it interacts with HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript:
                <br>

                1. Page Load and DOM Creation:
                When a web browser loads a webpage, it first fetches the HTML document from the server.
                The browser then parses the HTML document and constructs the DOM. The DOM is essentially a tree-like
                structure where each HTML element (like <div>, <p>, etc.) becomes a "node" in this tree.
                        As the browser parses the HTML, it creates the DOM in memory, so JavaScript can interact with it
                        later.
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        2. DOM Representation
                        The DOM represents the entire structure of the webpage in a hierarchical tree form. Every HTML
                        element, attribute, and text becomes a part of this tree.
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        3. DOM and CSS
                        Once the DOM is created, the browser then parses the CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that are
                        linked or embedded in the HTML.
                        The browser applies styles to the DOM elements based on CSS rules. The visual representation of
                        the page is determined by applying these styles to the DOM nodes.
